 # CS327_Roguelike_Dungeon
The work over a semester at Iowa State in c and c++ for CS327 to build a roguelike dungeon game.

The project as a whole is the work of me learning c and c++ over a samester. The first half of the semester we learned c and wrote
the project in c. About half way through we switched to c++ and had to port our project. As a whole I am very proud of this project 
and everthing I learned writing it. That said there are many issues with the current project as I was learning as it was created and
was only aware of my mistakes leater on. The entireity of the project was written be me excluding that of the heap, utils, and dice.
Which we written by my instructor to supplment the learning and to speed up the homework on more difficult assignments. The rlg327 is
an example of the hidden folder and the files that are used to generate the dungeon.
